#### Bio

I'm from Northern Spain and started my career as a freelance nature photographer after completing a visual arts baccalaureate. I later worked in the film industry, specializing in time-lapse and slow-motion techniques. Following my academic interests, I earned a Bachelor's in Anthropology and a PhD in Biology at Oxford University. Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Oxford ([profile](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/nilo-merino-recalde-0)) working across data science, ecology, and data visualization. My research interests include animal communication, language evolution, data visualization, machine learning, statistics, open science, and philosophy of science.
