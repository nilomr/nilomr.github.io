#### Bio
I was born in Northern Spain, where I completed a baccalaureate in visual arts
and worked as a freelance nature photographer. I then worked in the
film industry in a few different countries, where I specialized in time-lapse and slow-motion techniques. At
some point my academic interests prevailed, and I moved to the UK to study a Bachelor of Science in
Anthropology. I became interested in animal culture and communication, and
completed a PhD in Biology at the University of Oxford
([profile](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/nilo-merino-recalde-0)), where I
now work as a postdoctoral researcher. I have a wide range of interests that
include animal communication and the evolution of languages, data visualisation
and visual art, applied machine learning and statistics, open science and research methodology, and the philosophy of
science.
