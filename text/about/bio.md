#### Bio
I was born in Northern Spain, where I completed a baccalaureate in visual arts
and worked as a freelance nature photographer. I then transitioned to cinematography, where I specialized in time-lapse and slow-motion techniques. After this, I finished a bachelor of science in
Anthropology (Durham University, UK), where I took part in projects using
evolutionary theory to understand cultural diversity and became interested in
animal culture and communication. I am now completing a PhD thesis on bird song
learning and transmission at the University of Oxford ([profile](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/nilo-merino-recalde-0)). I have a wide range
of interests that include animal communication and the evolution of languages,
data visualisation, Bayesian inference, open science and research methodology, and the philosophy
of science.
