#### Bio

Born in Northern Spain, I began my journey with a baccalaureate in visual arts and worked as a freelance nature photographer. My career then took me to the film industry, where I specialized in time-lapse and slow-motion techniques. Eventually, my academic passions took precedence, leading me to the UK to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Anthropology. My fascination with animal culture and communication culminated in a PhD in Biology at the University of Oxford, where I now work as a postdoctoral researcher ([profile](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/nilo-merino-recalde-0)). My interests span a wide range, including animal communication and the evolution of languages, data visualization and visual art, applied machine learning and statistics, open science and research methodology, and the philosophy of science.
