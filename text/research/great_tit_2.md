### Analysing bird songs

Working with very large datasets is challenging and time-consuming: a main focus
of this project has been to develop methods and tools to make the task easier.
This includes segmentation and semi-supervised sound labelling methods, as well
as training large deep-lerning models that can learn to distinguish between
birds. Part of this work is now publised as a Python software library. (Read the paper here: [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10340v1.pdf), and see [docs](https://nilomr.github.io/pykanto/_build/html/index.html).)
