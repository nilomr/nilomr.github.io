### The cultural evolution of bird song

Tits have complex social lives, and their songs and calls play an important role
in them. In particular, their deceivingly simple songs—which they use to attract
mates and deter rivals—hide great diversity: in Wytham alone, great tits sing
perhaps over a hundred different ‘song types’. These song types must be learnt
from other birds early in their life, which creates fascinating cultural
dynamics.
