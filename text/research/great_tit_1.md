### The project
Our work aims to contribute to the understanding of animal vocalisations and
culture. We are studying the ‘cultural landscape’ of great tit song, and using
it as a model system to explore the interaction between ecology, population
processes and cultural evolutionary dynamics affecting learned vocalisations.

From the repertoires of individual birds to the complex dynamics that emerge at
the level of interacting populations, we want to gain a better understanding of
cultural change in bird song. What factors foster and constrain diversity, and which can lead to irreparable losses?
